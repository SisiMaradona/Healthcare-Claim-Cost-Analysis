# Healthcare-Claim-
This project analyzes healthcare claims to uncover the most expensive claim types, top-cost procedures (CPT codes) and diagnoses (ICD codes), high-cost members, and gaps between billed and paid amounts. The insights help drive cost control, optimize resource allocation, and support data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
